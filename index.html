                My name is Charles Sprayberry, I'm a software developer with an interest in unit testing, software architecture,
                asynchronous programming, and Open Source Software. I'm the Lead Web Application Developer at <a href="https://venture.co">VENTURE.co</a>
                where over the past 5~ years I have helped develop a suite of software to facilitate investments in private
                placements (high net-worth investors putting money into private companies). Before that I was the application
                developer at Wyatt Investment Research.

              <p class="content">
                I've developed software in Java, PHP, Ruby, JavaScript, and Python. I've utilized several different frameworks
                including <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, <a href="https://emberjs.com/">Ember</a>,

                that adheres to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">S.O.L.I.D.</a> principles. Before starting
                my career as a software developer I primarily worked in food service. Including a stint <a href="https://newskete.org/">smoking
                cheese for a monastery</a> and several years <a href="https://www.papajohns.com/">flipping pizzas for a big chain</a>.
                For a short time I answered hundreds of phone calls per day at a teleconferencing center.

                  Easily the most significant contribution during my time at VENTURE.co was the ability to mentor and guide my
                  fellow developers towards more understandable, simpler software solutions. By the time our current team
                  was established I had been with the company for 2 years and developed a solid understanding of our
                  business and the application stack that powered it. Being able to spread that business knowledge amongst
                  the team and see that directly lead to more soundly designed code was incredibly gratifying... and productive
                  for the company.

                  These interactions included code review, whiteboard designing sessions, sprint planning, debugging sessions,
                  and, occasionally, an informal type of pair programming. Our team was distributed and these communications
                  often involved a mixture of team members who were physically in the office and others who were remote; I would
                  often split my time between the office and my home.

                  In the world of private placements our engineering team was tasked with something that traditional tech
                  advice guides you to not do; collect highly-sensitive Personally Identifiable Information. I'm talking about
                  pieces of data like Social Security Numbers, Date of Births, Bank Accounts numbers, and other pieces of data
                  you wouldn't want just anybody to get their hands on. We had outsourced this project multiple times and due
                  to many considerations it was decided the functionality needed to be brought in-house.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                  After reviewing possible storage possibilities we wound up choosing <a href="">Hashicorp's Vault</a> but we
                  still needed a way to transparently store this data in Vault for both a Ruby and Java application. We wound
                  up implementing a similar solution for both technologies. By hooking into the ORM's lifecycle listeners we
                  were able to store the encrypted value in Vault while replacing the value inserted into the database with a
                  token. Upon hydrating objects from the database we would conduct the opposite process and read in the value
                  from Vault based on the stored token. This ensured that data at rest is stored in a secure, encrypted storage
                  and reduced the possibility that if a database breach occurred that sensitive information would be lost.

                  A really important part of handling private placements is dealing with escrow; the process of many investors
                  paying money into an account where it is held for a time until it is either refunded to the investor or
                  the sponsor of the raise receives the funds. One of our first solutions for this included a third-party
                  provider that was bought-out shortly after our live release which necessitated reimplementing the escrow
                  functionality virtually as soon as it went live.
                </p>

                <p class="content">
                  With the next implementation I designed a system that would allow the basic functionality of escrow to
                  take place within our application and domain while allowing "escrow processors" to be developed according
                  to an "interface", or as close you can get in Ruby. This system proved invaluable in ensuring that we
                  incurred minimal technical costs due to volatility with integrators in this space.

                  When VENTURE.co was getting started we were a small team and were primarily focused on customer facing functionality.
                  This left certain administrator functionality not as polished as we would have otherwise liked. One of the
                  issues faced was simply knowing when investors performed certain actions within the system. To faclitate this,
                  and other operations, I developed a chatbot that authenticated with our application through an Oauth 2 flow
                  as well as a webhook system that would send data about events triggered on our system with a simple HTTP POST
                  request. This system proved invaluable during our ramp-up period with ensuring that administrators were
                  properly notified when actions happened within the system as well as other helpful information fetching
                  activities.

                  When I arrived at Wyatt Investment Research the company was transitioning their app to Ruby on Rails.
                  During this transition there was a hard requirement, with a strict deadline that our current custom-implemented
                  credit card processing be transitioned to a new provider so that customer payments could be received
                  and employees could be paid. It was decided that the existing application was too untested and I did
                  not possess the knowledge needed for that level of refactor. Instead, I implemented a layer that sat
                  between our application and the new credit card processor that ensured the old batch payment format
                  was properly translated into the new processor's expected format and that the response was translated
                  into something the legay app could work with. This proved to be critical during the transition period
                  to ensure that customer payments continued to be received.

                I have been active in the OSS community, either through creating my own projects or contributing back to
                the libraries I use in those projects, since I started my programming career. The projects below are some
                of those I have worked on fairly recently and represent my most recent thoughts on software development.

                I have been mildly infatuated with creating my own framework since I realized what frameworks were. While
                I would not necessarily <em>recommend</em> that people create their own framework I find it enjoyable and it
                has allow me to learn a lot about programming that I can apply virtually any time that I'm designing a
                system. Labrador Kennel represents the 3rd generation of my own framework and is meant to be a suite of
                PHP libraries and packages that facilitate creating performant, secure applications using

                Yet Another PHP Enum. There are numerous examples of PHP libraries using class constants with scalar values
                as a type of pseudo-enum. However, I wanted something that could have type-safety, method calls, and
                generally to treat the concept of an enum as a first-class object in the PHP world. This library is a
                code generator that will create a type-safe, object-backed enum for you.

                I have recently been doing some development with real-time status updates and other functionality that is
                well-suited for websockets. I realized while building the app that the system for executing the commands
                based on the client's websocket messages could be its own micro-framework and shared with the community.

                Being a big fan of Test Driven Development it was important to me that my asynchronous apps and libraries
                be well tested. Testing asynchronous code has its own set of unique and interesting challenges relative to
                testing blocking code. With the help of the maintainers of the amphp project I was able to design and
                develop an AsyncTestCase implementation that greatly reduces the amount of boilerplate required for async
                testing and has become the de facto test case for asynchronous code within Amp.
